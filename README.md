## üåà What is this?

[`yamlfix`](https://github.com/lyz-code/yamlfix) is a simple, opinionated yaml formatter that keeps your comments
and is written by [lyz](https://github.com/lyz-code/).

This Docker image intends to bring the awesomeness of [`yamlfix`](https://github.com/lyz-code/yamlfix) to Docker and
especially [whalebrew](https://github.com/whalebrew/whalebrew).

## üõ† Usage

You can use this with plain Docker:

    $ docker run --rm otherguy/yamlfix your_yaml_file.yaml

Or you can install it using [whalebrew](https://github.com/whalebrew/whalebrew) and use it simply with `yamlfix`:

    $ whalebrew install otherguy/yamlfix
    $ yamlfix your_yaml_file.yaml
